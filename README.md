# Learn Me Some Groovy

Scripts written while trying and tweaking examples given in the book 'Groovy in Action' and are not always exact representations of the examples in the book. Areas covered so far:

  - Basics of the language to get you going (finding your groove)
  - Simple data types
  - Collections
  - Closures
  - Control structures
  - Object orientation

## Exercises

There are more scripts under 'exercises' that were done to show the progress made:

- Roman Numerals

## Running The Scripts

Running the scripts including exercises is simple. Being in the respective directory, just run the script you wish to, using the groovy command e.g.:

```sh
$ groovy RomanNumerals
```
