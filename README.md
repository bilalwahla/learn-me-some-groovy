# Learn Me Some Groovy

Following scripts were written while trying and tweaking examples given in the book 'Groovy in Action' and are not exact representations of the examples in the book.

  - Book.groovy
  - BookGroovyBean.groovy
  - MyFirstGroovyScript.groovy
  - SimpleGroovyDataTypes.groovy
  - CollectiveGroovyDataTypes.groovy
  - WorkingWithClosures.groovy
  - ControlStructures.groovy

## Roman Numerals Script

There is another script apart from the ones mentioned above i.e. 'RomanNumerals.groovy'. This was done as an exercise to show off what I learnt from the first 7 chapters of the 'Groovy in Action' book.

## Running The Scripts

Running the scripts including Roman Numerals exercise is simple. Just run the script you wish to using the groovy command e.g.

```sh
$ groovy RomanNumerals
```
